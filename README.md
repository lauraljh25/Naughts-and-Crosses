# Naughts-and-Crosses
A small Naughts and Crosses game made using C# and windows forms, for one or two players. 

One Player: Play against a very simple program that will pick a space at random to place a naught. 

Two Players: Each player takes it in turns to place either a naught or a cross, depending on what player they are, using the same mouse.
